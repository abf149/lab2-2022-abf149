## TODO

1. Please check README files in this repository carefully. Please read the rules for the in-class competition, sign the agreement form, and check the Kaggle page for the competition. 
2. Determine which GPU platform you are going to use for this lab. In case you are using personal GPU, make sure you install PyTorch with GPU support, independent of this Docker. Note that this Docker does not support GPU. 
3. Download the dataset from the Kaggle competition page. If you are using Google Colab, upload the dataset to your drive as well. 
4. Train your neural network. You can use the starter codes, or can write your own script. Please commit the updated training code you are using. 
5. Now, launch the Docker, and run the energy/latency estimation for the model you trained (you can start running the estimation before the training is completed - all you need for this part is the description of the model, not the exact parameters).
6. Prepare your submission for the Kaggle. Your filename should include the energy and latency information. Check the submission helper function in the starter codes. 
7. Update your result summary in this README.md file. Also, make sure to commit and push your training code that includes your model description, training method (hyperparameters), and the updated `network-profile.ipynb`.
